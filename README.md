## Hexxagon
This repository contains the implementation of a strategic board game
called Hexxagon using Python and the pygame library. The game supports
multiple modes, including Human vs Human, AI vs AI, and Human vs AI, with
AI strategies implemented using Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms.
The objective is to provide an engaging gameplay experience while
showcasing the implementation of advanced AI techniques.
## Objectives
1. Create a visually appealing hexagonal grid-based board game.
2. Implement various player types:
• Human players.
• AI players using Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning.
• Random move generators.
3. Provide multiple gameplay modes:
   
   Human vs Human, AI vs AI, and Human vs AI,
 
4. Ensure smooth interaction and user-friendly UI.

# Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.10 or higher

Pygame library

Follow these steps:

```sh

# Install the necessary dependencies.
pip install pygame

```
# How to Play

Open hexxagon.ipynb in VS Code and Run All cells to enter into Game setup.

Game Setup

1.Select player types for Player 1 and Player 2 using dropdown menus:

2.Options: Human, AI-minimax, AI-alpha-beta, Random.(for each player)

- Click on the "Start Game" button to begin.

# Rules
1.Players take turns placing or moving their pieces on the hexagonal grid.

2.Pieces can either clone to adjacent cells or jump to adjacent of adjacent cells.

3.Opponent's pieces adjacent to the moved piece are converted to the current player's color.

4.The game ends when no valid moves are possible or the grid is full.

# Winning Criteria
1.The player with the most pieces on the board at the end of the game wins.

## Code structure

The notebook contains 29 cells, divided into 15 code cells and 14 markdown cells. Below is the structured breakdown of the contents:

1. Modules and Initialization
Purpose: Import necessary libraries and initialize constants.

Code Cell:

- Import libraries: pygame, sys, math, copy, random.

- Initialize Pygame: pygame.init().

- Define constants like screen dimensions, colors, and fonts.

2. UI Components
Purpose: Define reusable classes for UI elements like buttons and dropdowns.

Code Cell:

- Button Class: Handles rendering buttons and detecting mouse events.

- Dropdown Class: Manages dropdown menus for selecting player types.

- Callback functions to handle player selection.

3. Game Setup
Purpose: Initialize the game board and define grid-related functions.

Code Cell:

- Functions to create a hexagonal grid (create_hexagonal_grid), set hexagon states (set_hexagon), and render the grid (draw_grid).

- Functions to calculate scores, display scores, and declare winners.

4. Game Logic
Purpose: Implement core game mechanics such as moves, scoring, and AI strategies.

Code Cell:

- Functions to calculate valid moves (get_valid_moves) and execute moves (execute_move).

AI implementations:

- Minimax algorithm (minimax) with depth-limited search.

- Alpha-Beta pruning (minimax_alpha_beta) for optimization.

- Random move selection (random_play).

5. Game Modes
Purpose: Define various game modes based on player types (Human/AI).

Code Cells:

Modes include:

- Human vs Human

- AI-Minimax vs AI-Minimax

- AI-Alpha-Beta vs AI-Alpha-Beta

- Random vs Random

- Human vs Random

- AI-Minimax vs Random

- AI-Alpha-Beta vs Random

- AI-Minimax vs Human

- AI-Alpha-Beta vs Human

6. Main Menu
Purpose: Create a start menu with dropdowns for player selection and a start button.

Code Cell:

- Dropdowns for selecting Player 1 and Player 2 types.

- Start button to launch the selected game mode.
